# Image Lists Project

This project demonstrates an ability to:
  1. Initialize two image lists
  2. Fill them with images
  3. Initialize third image list
  4. Copy one image from each image list to the third one
  5. Set the first image as an overlay for the second one
  6. Draw it with its overlay to the console
 
 The code is heavily commented in case of questions.
